gsb 
is a minimalist, bootable OS that launches apps right in containers of any system for which you have an .iso. Feel free to throw any file in /gsb, the dump, it will auto generate tags in an index to keep track of everything, which is just a search away. 

Try typing "star wars", when you have all those legally downloaded! 

It should suggest each "star wars" file on device in logical order and then can search or chat for more.
